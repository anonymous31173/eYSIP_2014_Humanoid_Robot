Steps:
1.The micro-controller is powered by a 12V 1A adapter.
2.The signal pins from the micro-controller is connected to the general purpose board on the robot as indicated there number wise.
3.The general purpose board has a separate T-connector for the power supply of all the 16 servo motors.
4.The power supply rated 6V and 5000mAh can be used to drive the servos, this can given either from a battery or from a external power source.
5.If a battery is used than use it along with a battery protection circuit provided, so as monitor the voltage continuously. If the voltage goes below 5V for a 6V battery then it would cause problem in charging. Hence it is advisable to use the battery protection circuit.
6.Once you get the low voltage signal, then charge the battery using the battery charger.

* First switch on the servo power supply then switch on the micro-controller.
* During programming switch off the servo power supply.
